INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE CONCEPTS
=================================

1) Understanding the Data & Database & Database Management System (DBMS)
========================================================================
        Data >> Information about any Real World Object
            Ex:- Chairs, Tables, Mobiles, Computer, Laptop, Student, Employee, Customer etc...,

        Example : If we are considering the College Management System of Student

            Student
            =======
            RollNo, Name, Branch, Gender, Age ---> Data (It is something particular about one student)

        Database >> Grouping of Data in structured Format (or) Grouping of Several Student Information.

          Student1                        Student2                      Student3
          ========                        ========                      ========
       RollNo  : 1121                  RollNo  : 2255                RollNo  : 8956
       Name    : Bhavya                Name    : Sweety              Name    : Ram
       Branch  : CSE                   Branch  : IT                  Branch  : ECE
       Gender  : Male                  Gender  : Female              Gender  : Male
       Age     : 22                    Age     : 21                  Age     : 30


        Database Management System(DBMS) >> It is a technique for storing and reteriving the information from
                                            Database. 

        In this Digital Era (or) In our Day-2-Day life we are seeing the lot of application such as Naukri Portal,
        Monster Portal, Flipkart, Amazon etc...,

        EndUser >> Interacting the Application >> Runs in Server at Remote Machine >> Servers Connected To Database
        (Managing the Information of an Application).

2) Various techniques for Managing the Data
===========================================
    
    >> Traditional Approach (Books (or) Ledger Books) >> Collection of Pages >> Each Page >>
       One Student Information.
    
        Problems
        ========
        1) Security Challenges.
        2) Backup issues.
        3) Space issues.
        4) Costly.
        5) Time consuming for retrieving particular Student Information.


    >> In the 1940's computers wes discovered and people are thinking to store this kind of information in computer.

    >> After discovering the computer the people are managing the data in the form of Files (or) File System.
       
        Problems
        ========
        1) Security Challenges
        2) Data Redundancy >> Duplication of Data (or) Repeatitive Data.

            Student.txt                                  StudentBranches.txt
            ===========                                  ===================
            StudentID  StudentName                       StudentID  BranchName
            ---------  -----------                       ---------  ----------
        3) Data Inconsistency : When ever we are updating studentID in One file may forget to update in another file.
           
            Student.txt                                  StudentBranches.txt
            ===========                                  ===================
            StudentID  StudentName                       StudentID  BranchName
            ---------  -----------                       ---------  ----------
        4) Time Consuming For Storing and Retrieving Information from Files (or) FileSystem (or) Flat Files.
        5) We can't maintaining the Backups of files.
        6) We can store limited amount of Information Only in Files.

    Database Softwares
    ==================
      * Currently In Market we are managing the of an application in Database Softwares.


      Advantages
      ==========
      1) Strong Security.
      2) Manage and Storing and Retreving the Information.
      3) We can store the huge Amount of Information in Database.
      4) we can maintain the data in database in structured format(Tables(Rows and Columns)).
          Table >> Realworld Entity >> Student.
          Columns >> Fields >> Rollno, Name, Branch, Gender.
          Rows >> Values >> 123, Bhavya, CSE, Male.
      5) No Data Redundancy.
      6) Data Integrity.
      7) Association.

3) Database Softwares
=====================
    - Oracle Database >> Oracle Corporation >> Propertiary License
    - MySql Database >> Oracle Corporation >> Open Source
    - DB2 Database >> IBM Corporation
    - SQL Server Database >> Microsoft Corporation
    - Derby Database >> Sun MicroSystem
    - PostgreSql Database etc.....,

  NOTE :
  ------ 
  - The above database comes under category "RDBMS Database Softwares". 
  - In the Relational Database Management System the data will be managed in the form of Relations(Tables).
  - In the Relational Database Management System always data will be in Structured Fromat i.e.,Tables
  - Table will contains Rows & Columns with Respective to the RDBMS Columns >> Fields
                                                                    Rows    >> Tuples
                                                                    Tables  >> Relations


    customers(Table)
    ================
    Customer_ID       Customer_Name         Customer_Location
    ===========       =============         =================
      1025              Bhavya                  Haryana           >>Tuples
      1026              Sweety                  Rajasthan         >>Tuples
      1027              Ram                     Delhi             >>Tuples
      1028              Sham                    Goa               >>Tuples
      1029              Geeta                   Hyderabad         >>Tuples

    - Fields >> Customer_ID,Customer_Name,Customer_Location.
    - Program ::: Only Two RDBMS Softwares (Oracle,MySQL)
    - Generally In RealWorld who one person will communicate with another person >> Language >> English(Communication).
    - If the enduser wanted to communicate with RDBMS Database Softwares >> Language >> SQL(Structure Query Language).
    - Relational Databases are also called as "SQL Databases"

                                                    Day - 2

1) Types of Database Softwares
==============================
            * We have two types of Database Softwares.
                    1) RDBMS Database Software / SQL Databases : Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, PostgreSql, DB2, Derby etc..,
                       - In RDBMS/SQL Database always data will be stored in two dimensional format i.e.,Tables.
                       - Table will Contains Rows & Columns, Always Column represented as "Fields" and
                         Rows represented as "tuples" and Table represented as "Relation".
                       - In RDBMS/SQL Database always data will be stored in "Structured Format".
                       - In Realtime most of banking application, e-commerce application are using RDBMS
                         Database Softwares only.

                    2) NRDBMS Database Software / No-SQL Databases : Data will be managed in several Formats.
                              -Document based Databases >> No SQL Database >> Mongo DB >> Internally Data will be stored in
                                                                                          JSON Format.
                              {
                                "customerId":"123",
                                "customerName":"Bhavya"
                              } 

                              - Key-Value Based Database >> No SQL Database >> Cassandra DB, Dynamo DB.
                              - Column Based Database >> No SQL Database >> HBase etc....
                              - Graph Database >> No SQL Database >> Neo4J, GraphQL etc.., 

    * Database is meant for storing data of an Application.
    * Always Data will be Populated into Database from Several Application.
       Ex: Internet Banking >> We are performing some transaction on day-2-day Activities this will leads generate data
                               into database.

                                                    Day - 3

Structured Query Language(SQL)
==============================
                - SQL Stands for structured Query Language.
                - SQL is used to communicate with any RDBMS Database Softwares.
                - SQL is database Query language/ database programming language.
                - As End user we can pass statement to execute in Database such statements called "SQL statement / Queries".
                - SQL statements are just like normal English statements.
                - We can write the sql statements either in upper case letter (or) lower case letters i.e., SQL is 
                  case-Insensitive Database programming language.
                - SQL Language becomes ANSI(American National Standard Information) Standard will become common language 
                  for any RDBMS Database software /SQL Database softwares.
                - When we writing the SQL Statements every SQL statements must be terminated with Semicolon(;).
                - In SQL at a time only one SQL Statement will be executed.
                - If we wanted to execute some bunch of SQL statement at a time for you buisness requirement we need to go for 
                  "PLSQL".
                - Procedural Language using SQL.
    
  Example
  =======

    customers(Table)
    ================
    Customer_ID       Customer_Name         Customer_Location
    ===========       =============         =================
      1026              Sweety                  Rajasthan      
      1027              Ram                     Delhi          
      1025              Bhavya                  Haryana        
      1028              Sham                    Goa            
      1029              Geeta                   Hyderabad      

 * If we store the above customer information into database we can get the particular customer information based on our
   buisness requirement in easy manner.

   EndUser >> Writing SQL Statement >> Based on buisness requirement (need to get All Customer Information belongs
                                       to Hyderabad)

            select * from customers where Customer_Location='Hyderabad'; >> SQL Statement (or) Query >> Milli Seconds
                                                                            information will be infront of you.

            select * from customer; >> It will give you all customer information.

Today Session
=============

1) What is Oracle?
==================
     * Oracle is an one of the RDBMS Database Software which can maintain the data in structured Format.
     * In Oracle Always Data will be stored in two-dimensional Format / Tabular Format.
     * Oracle Database is From Oracle Corporation.
     * Using SQL Language we can interact with Oracle Database.
     * Oracle contains two Parts
        1) SQL >> Which is used to storing and managing and retreving Data from database software.
        2) PLSQL >> Executing some buisness rules/buisness logic in Database Software using stored procedure, Stored Functions.
     * Oracle Latest Version of Express Edition : Oracle 21C Express Edition.

2) Installing Oracle (or) Enviromental setup For Oracle
=======================================================
    Step-1 : We are going to Install the Oracle 11g Express Edition which is an Light weight version of Oracle
             Database and download the Oracle Database in the below url.
       URl : https://www.mediafire.com/file/ungqk8ggwof4h1h/OracleXE112_Win64.zip/file 

    Step-2 : After Completion of Downloading need to extract the zip file into folder by using either 
             winzip/7Zip Software.
           Extracting the ZIP File  >>>>>>> Normal Folder

    Step-3 : Open the Extracted the Folder and find the executable file(.exe file) 
             in below location in extracted folder.
           <Oracle_Home>\DISK1\setup.exe
           <Oracle_Home>  >> A Place where Oracle Database Software is available i.e.,Oracle Home

    Step-4 : Complete the installation process just by double clicking on it 
             untill finish button (or) Just like normal Software Installation process in our machine.

    Step-5 : During the Oracle Database Installation we need to rememeber password given for DBA
             Account(sys (or) system) and we provided the password for DBA accounts in my case as "**********".

NOTE : Just For Your Information
================================
Destination Folder: C:\oraclexe\
Oracle Home: C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\
Oracle Base:C:\oraclexe\
Port for 'Oracle Database Listener': 1521
Port for 'Oracle Services for Microsoft Transaction Server': 2030
Port for 'Oracle HTTP Listener': 8080

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Interacting with Oracle Database
================================
* Inorder to interact with Oracle database, Oracle vendor provided "SQL* Plus editor" which is an "Command Line Interface"

   Go to Start menu >> Search word as  "SQL" >> Find the Option as "Run SQL Command Line prompt" will comes along with the 
   Oracle 11g Express edition installation process

* After opening the SQL Command Line execute the below command to connect with oracle Database Software

     SQL> connect(Hit Enter)
     Enter user-name: system(Hit Enter)
     Enter password:manager(Password will not visible to You just we need to type password and hit on enter)
     Connected.

     SQL>> Show user  (Viewing current user name)
  
     SQL>> cl scr (clear screen)
  
     SQL>> exit (Quit from SQL Prompt)
     
     SQL>> select * from all_users;

                                                    Day - 5

Interacting with Oracle Database
=================================
Approach-1 
----------
Using Command Line Interface(CLI) oracle Database i.e.,Sql*plus

  Start Menu >> Search Word "sql" >> Find option "Run SQL Command Line" >> Select that Option will open SQL Prompt


     SQL >>  Connect 


     Enter Username ::: System

     Enter Password ::: manager(not visible)

     Connected


     SQL >> show user

      OUTPUT
      ======
       system

 
      SQL >> Select * from all_users;  >> To get all the users information from Oracle Database

       OUTPUT
       ======
         Users Information

      SQL>> cl scr  >>> Clearing the Screen


      SQL >> exit   >>> Exiting the SQL Prompt

Approach-2 
----------
>>  By Using Oracle WebPage we can interact with Oracle Database and during installation of Oracle11g Express Edition we got      one webpage into our Machine Desktop  i.e., "Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition"


>>  When we Open the following page i.e.,Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition by default it will given you an
 
    error because need to configure the Oracle Port Listener Number(8080) for this webPage.


>>> Adding the Oracle Listener Port Number to the above web page

    Right Click on the web page >>> choose an option "Open File Location" >>> select "Get Started" Page and Right click on  
    this page >>> Select the option "Properties" >> Change the url as below

          Exisiting URL ::::    http://127.0.0.1:%HTTPPORT%/apex/f?p=4950 

 
          Changed URL   ::::   http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4950 

>>> After the doing the Above url change now just try to open the Same Page.....Will be getting Some Home Page 

    Select option "Application Express" >> will getting another Screen infront of you

             Create Database User  >>> Create new User (Select this Option)

                 Username          >>> bhavya

    Application Express Workspace  >>> bhavya

                 Password          >>>  (Invisible Characters)

       Confirm Password            >>>  (Invisible Characters)


   We need to Click on button  "Create Workspace" >>After clicking on it will get Success Message workspace got created.


>>> We need to Login with New credentials of an Newly created workspace

          Workspace name  :::: bhavya

          username        :::: bhavya

          password        :::: 124444

         Click on  "Login" Button

>>> After Login we need select menu "SQL Workshop"

       1) SQL Commands    >>> Here we can write the required Sql Commands to test with oracle Database


       2) Object Browser  >>> We can see the Oracle Database Objects information (table,views,sequences,SP,SF etc.,)

                          >>> Using this option we can create any Database Object using graphical Objects.

Approach - 3
------------
      * we can interact with oracle Database by using Graphical User Interface(GUI) Tools.
      * Inorder to interact with Oracle Database we have some GUI Tools i.e.,Oracle SQL Developer, Toad For Oracle tec...,

ERROR:ORA-12543: TNS:destination host unreachable
=================================================
1) Verify Services in our machine related Oracle.

   Go to run option  >> Type word  "services.msc" >> Find oracle related Services is in Running or not

             OracleXETNSListener    >> Running

             OracleServiceXE        >> Running

2) Navigate to Oracle Installation Folder >> Search with following file "tnsnames.ora"  >> Edit this file and change the    service name XE  >> ORCL.


3) Verify Your system is enabled with Firewall or not, If it enabled just disable it and try onces


ERROR : Checking for Oracle XE service instance FAILED, How to solve this problem sir
=====================================================================================
Solution ::: Swith to Command Prompt  >>> type the below command 

               C:\Users\NEW>sc delete OracleServiceXE

1) we can able to login DBA Account(system,manager) either in Webpage (or) SQL*plus client Application.
2) we can able to login Database Developer Account(bhavya(******)) either in webpage (or) sql*Plus client Application.

**********************************
Interacting with Oracle Database
**********************************
Approach-1 
----------
Using Command Line Interface(CLI) oracle Database i.e.,Sql*plus

  Start Menu >> Search Word "sql" >> Find option "Run SQL Command Line" >> Select that Option will open SQL Prompt


     SQL >>  Connect 


     Enter Username ::: System

     Enter Password ::: (not visible)

     Connected


     SQL >> show user

      OUTPUT
      ======
       system

 
      SQL >> Select * from all_users;  >> To get all the users information from Oracle Database

       OUTPUT
       ======
         Users Information

      SQL>> cl scr  >>> Clearing the Screen


      SQL >> exit   >>> Exiting the SQL Prompt

Approach-2 
----------
>>  By Using Oracle WebPage we can interact with Oracle Database and during installation of Oracle11g Express Edition we got 
    one webpage into our Machine Desktop  i.e., "Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition"


>>  When we Open the following page i.e.,Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition by default it will given you an 
    error because need to configure the Oracle Port Listener Number(8080) for this webPage.


>>> Adding the Oracle Listener Port Number to the above web page
    Right Click on the web page >>> choose an option "Open File Location" >>> select "Get Started" Page and Right click on  
    this page >>> Select the option "Properties" >> Change the url as below

          Exisiting URL ::::    http://127.0.0.1:%HTTPPORT%/apex/f?p=4950 

 
          Changed URL   ::::   http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4950 

>>> After the doing the Above url change now just try to open the Same Page.....Will be getting Some Home Page 
    Select option "Application Express" >> will getting another Screen infront of you

             Create Database User  >>> Create new User (Select this Option)

                 Username          >>> bhavya

    Application Express Workspace  >>> bhavya

                 Password          >>> (Invisible Characters)

       Confirm Password            >>> (Invisible Characters)


   We need to Click on button  "Create Workspace" >>After clicking on it will get Success Message workspace got created.


>>> We need to Login with New credentials of an Newly created workspace

          Workspace name  :::: bhavya

          username        :::: bhavya

          password        :::: ******

         Click on  "Login" Button

>>> After Login we need select menu "SQL Workshop"

       1) SQL Commands    >>> Here we can write the required Sql Commands to test with oracle Database


       2) Object Browser  >>> We can see the Oracle Database Objects information (table,views,sequences,SP,SF etc.,)

                          >>> Using this option we can create any Database Object using graphical Objects.

Approach-3
==========
 * We can interact with Oracle Database by using Graphical User Interface(GUI) Tools.

 * Inorder to interact with Oracle Database we have some GUI Tools i.e.,Oracle SQL Developer,Toad For Oracle etc..,

Step-1 :
--------
Downlaod the SQL Developer Software from Oracle Corporation.
 
  URL :https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/  >>> Current Version (22.2.1)

 NOTE
 ====
  If we required to download the Oracle Products definetly need to have account with Oracle WebSite.
  
      Oracle Products ::: Oracle 11g Express Edition , Oracle SQL Developer Tool, Java Software etc.,

Step-2
------
 After completion of Download as zip file we need to extract the Zip file to Normal Folder by using either winzip/7-zip     Software

      sqldeveloper-22.2.1.234.1810-x64.zip   >>>>> sqldeveloper-22.2.1.234.1810-x64(Normal Folder)

Step-3
------
  Switch/navigate to Extracted Folder and click on following executable file i.e.,sqldeveloper.exe and will open Sql      Developer tool page.  
  
  In the left hand side we have two panels 1) Connections 2) Reports 

Step-4
------
  We need to create new Connection in SQL Developer Tool by clicking on "Green Color + Icon" onces you clicked on it 
  need to provide the below Inputs
     
       Connection Name :::  DBA_CONNECTION   (Given Color as Red Color)

        username : system

        password : ******

        Hostname : localhost

        port :1521

        sid : xe

  We need to Verify the whether Database Connection will be success or not by clicking on "Test" Button.

  If we are getting success then we need to click on "Connect" Button

Step-5
------
  We need to SQL Queries/SQL Statements by using SQL Developer Tool

  Right Click on Connection Name(DBA_CONNECTION) under Connection Panel >> Choose an Option "Open SQL Work Sheet".

  Once SQL Worksheet got Opened we can write and test our required SQL statements

     select sysdate from dual;

  Executing the above Statement ::::: select the entire sql statement(ctrl+A) >>>> Click on "Run" Button(Green Color) on tool 
  bar.


NOTE
=====
1) We can able to login DBA Account(system,manager) either in Webpage (or) SQL*plus Client Application.

2) We can able to login Database Developer Account(mahesh(ashokit), rajesh(ashokit)) either in webpage (or) sql*plus client   
   application

   Already Having Account : http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4500:1000:4516113379588092

                                                     Day - 7

* we seen How to Interact with oracle Database using three approach

    1) Command Line Interface(CLI) i.e, SQL*Plus
    2) Web page
    3) Graphical User Interface(GUI) i.e, Oracel SQL Developer, Toad for Oracle etc., >>> Trending in Market

Oracle accounts
---------------

1) Database Administrator Account(DBA) Account i.e, sys(or)system
2) we created some Database User using WebPage Approach i.e., bhavya.
3) We Will Create one Database user using CLI Approach i.e.,

     step-1 : Creating the user using CLI Screen
     --------------------------------------------
            
            SQL > create user ramesh identified by password;
               User Created.

      NOTE:
      =====
          Database Username : ramesh and Database Password: password


    step-2 : Giving the Permissions to Newly Created User i.e,ramesh
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

            SQL> grant resource,connect to ramesh;
              Grant secceeded.

    Note: After Creating the User make sure we need to give Permissions for Creating Database Objects 
          (Table, sequence, Index, View, Stored procedure, Stored Function etc.,)


    Step-3 : Connectng to newly created user using CLI Approach
    -----------------------------------------------------------  
         SQL> connect
         Enter user-name: ramesh
         Enter password: 
         Connected.
    
Note:
=====
* We can always create an new Database user account through DBA Account only.
* We Can't create newly Database user account from another User Account.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SQL Commands
------------
* SQL Commands is nothing but SQL Statements (or) SQL Queries.
* Basically Statement represents performing the particular task (or) Statement is group of predefined words
  Example : select * from emp;
* Every Statement must be terminated by Semicolon.
* The Statement which we are Passed to Database Software System such statement is called as "SQL Statements".
* Basically SQL Commands/SQL Statements are categorized as below

  1) Data Definition Language(DDL) Commands (or) DDL Statements. 
     >> Deals with Creating/Modifying/Dropping Structure of Database object.
     >> DDL Commands are "create, alter, drop"

  2) Data Manipulation Language(DML) Commands (or) DML Statements.
     >> Deals with Data for an Database objects.
     >> DML Commands are "insert, Update, delete".

  3) Data Control Language(DCL) Commands (or) DCL Statements.
     >> Deals with giving the Permission (or) Revoking the permission of an users.
     >> DCL Commands are used By "DBA Persons"
     >> DCL Commands are "grant,revoke"

  4) Data Retrevial Language(DRL) Commands (or) DRL Statements.
     >> Deals with Retreving the data from Database Objects.
     >> DRL Commands are "select"

  5) Transaction Control Language(TCL) Commands (or) TCL Statements.
     >> Deals with Transaction Management
     >> TCL Commands are "commit, rollback, savepoint"

                                                     Day - 8

Database Object >> Table
========================
* To Create a Database Object of an Table we need to user DDL Command of "create".
* After creating the Database object of an Table in Databae as a Programmer we need to insert data into table then we need to use DML 
  command "insert".
* After Inserting the data into Database as a Programmer we need to validate the information by using DRL command "select".

Example : Creating a sample Database table 
==========================================

write a Query for creating Database Table of "customers" information with following fields
              >  CustomerId     >>   only numbers 
              >  CustomerName   >>   strings 
              >  Gender         >>   strings
              >  Age            >>   only numbers
              >  Location       >>   string

>> In Order to create the Database table we will use DDL Command "create" and obseve the syntx as below.

          create table <table_name>(
                                      <column_name_1> <Datatype>,
                                      <column_name_2> <Datatype>,
                                      ..........................,
                                      ..........................,
                                      <column_name_n> <Datatype>,
                                   ); 

  NOTE: Naming Conventions need to be follow for any name in Oracle Database
  ==========================================================================
    1) Every name in the Database must begins with "Alphabet".
    2) We need to follow the mentioned charset i.e., a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, $, #, _,  
    3) Names are not Case Sensitive.
    4) Predefined Keywords are not allowed.
    5) Blank Spaces are also not allowed in the names.

  Query For Creating Database table
  =================================
    create table demo_customers(customer_id number,
                                customer_name varchar(50),
                                gender varchar(15),
                                age number,
                                location varchar(50),
                              );

    OUTPUT
    ======
    Table created.
  
step 2:
=======
  *Inserting the data into Database table by using DML Command "insert".


   Syntax for insert command 
   =========================

   1) insert into <table_name>(column_name_1, column_name_2..................column_name_n) values(value1, value2,.....valuen);

   Example
   -------
    insert into demo_customers(customer_id,customer_name,gender,age,location) values (01,'Bhavya','Male',22,'Hyderabad');

    insert into demo_customers(customer_id,customer_name,gender,age,location) values (02,'Sweety','Female',21,'Hyderabad');


    2) insert into <table_name> values(value1,value2,value3................valuen);

    Example
    -------
       insert into demo_customers values(03, 'Rajesh', 'Male', 40, 'Mumbai');
    
    3) insert into <table_name> values(&customer_id,&customer_name,&gender,&age,&location);
    



step 3:
=======
 * Just Validating the Information by selecting data from Dtabase Table using DRL Command "select"

 Syntax for select command
 =========================
      select * from <table_name>;  >> Retrieves all the information from given table

  Example
  =======
     select * from demo_customer;

  NOTE
  ====
   SQL> set linesize 200;  

   How can we clear the Screen of oracle SQL* Plus Editor
   ======================================================

    SQL >> cl scr

   How can we increase the chracters per line oracle SQL* Plus Editor
   ===================================================================
        SQL >> set linesize <number>; Ex: set linesize 300;

                                                     Day - 9

How to Modify the data in Database Table
========================================
 * By using update statement we can change the Exisiting column value based on some conditions.
 * Condition means whether you want to update columns values for all records (or) particular record.
 * If you omit (or) ignore the condition in the update statement then will performs update all records of columns values will be reflected.

 Syntax For Updating all rows in the Database table
 ==================================================
      update table <table_name> set <modifyingcolumn1>=<modifyingcolumn1value>....<modifyingcolumnn>=<modifyingcolumnnvalue>

  Example : write SQL Query to update the location as "Delhi" for all customers in demo_customer table

      SQL >>>> update demo_customer set location='Delhi';

      Result ::: 3 rows updated.

 Syntax For Updating Particular rows in the Database table
 ==========================================================
      update table <table_name> set <modifyingcolumn1>=<modifyingcolumn1value>....<modifyingcolumnn>=<modifyingcolumnnvalue>
                              where <condtion>
    
        Example : write SQL Query to update the location as "Delhi" for particular customers in demo_customer table
                  whose customer_id is 1

        SQL >>> update demo_customer set location='Delhi' where customer_id = 1;

        Example : write SQL Query to update the location as "Delhi" for particular customers in demo_customer table
                  whose customer_name is sweety

        SQL >>> update demo_customer set location='Delhi' where customer_name = 'Sweety';

        Result ::::: 1 row updated.

        Example : write SQL Query to update the location as "Pune" and age "22" for particular customers in demo_customer table
                  whose customer_name is bhavya

        SQL >>> update demo_customer set location='Pune', age=40 where customer_name = 'Bhavya';

        SQL >>> update demo_customer set location='Pune', age=40 where customer_name = 'Bhavya' and gender='Male';

 
 NOTE: 
 =====
 * As of now in our table we have only one customer record name as "Bhavya" that is reason we are getting only one row updated 
   in the above updated SQL statements.

 * If we are having more than one customer whose customer names having "Bhavya" then will get respective rows matched got updated.

 * In the Realtime always recommended to perform the update statement based on the customer_id because customer_id will be
   unique for every customer.

 * we used two predefined keywords in update statement i.e., set and where

     "set" is used for defining the modifying columns in Database table.
     
     "where" is used specifying the condition to update the particular row (or) rows in database table.

How to Remove the Unwanted records from Database Table
======================================================
* By using delete command from DML Statements.

* By using delete command we can remove the unwanted records from Database Table.

* If you specifying the where in delete statement then will delete particular records based on condition specified.

* If you omit (or) ignore the condition in delete statement then will delete all rows from Database Table.

 Syntax
 ======
        delete from <table_name>;

  Ex: delete from demo_customer; >>>>>> It will delete all rows from database table because we don't have any where condition
                                        in sql statement.

 Syntax
 ======
        delete from <table_name> where <Conditions>;
  
   Ex: delete from demo_customer where customer_id=1; >>> Deleting record from Table whose customer_id as 1

       delete from demo_customer where customer_name='Bhavya'; >>> Deleting record from Table whose customer_name as 'Bhavya' 

       delete from demo_customer where gender='Male'; >>> Deleting customer from Table whose gender as "Male"

       delete from demo_customer where gender='Male' and age>=35; >>> Deleting customers from Table whose gender as "Male" and age
                                                                      Should be greater than 35.

Today Session ::: Oracle Datatypes
==================================

  Datatype >>> It is used to define the type of the value to be holded in the database column.

  Basically Oracle classified the datatypes in the below categories.

  1) Number
  =========
   * These datatypes allow used to define the numeric/number value into the databas column such as integers(whole numbers) (or) 
     decimal numbers(fractional numbers).

      Whole numbers :: 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,85,58,958 etc.,

      decimal numbers :: 10.285,25.36,85.47,1232.1 etc.,

   i) number(size)
   ===============
       > This datatype allows us to define only integers (or) whole numbers either positive or negative numbers such as
         studentrollno, employeeno, customerbillno etc.,

       > Here size represents the numbers of digits.

    Example
    =======
       studentNo number(4) >>>> 9999


   ii) number(precision,scale)
   ===========================
      > This datatype allows us to define decimal values (or) fractional  value such as student average marks, employee salary,
        Bill Amount of an Customer, Interest Rates in Bank etc.,

      > Here Precision means no of digits including decimal values where as scale means no of decimal value.
         
         Example
         =======
            employeesalary number(6,2); >>>> 9999.99

            billAmount number(8,3); >>>> 12345.678

2) Alphabets : This datatype further divided into below types 
============
     
     i) char(size) :
     ===============
        > This datatype allows us to define character values  such as employee names, student names etc.,

        > The maximum length of datatype is 1-2000 chracters.

        > It always allocates the memory in a static passion.

          Example:
          ========
              studentName char(25);
              Name of Student ::: Bhavya

        Dis : This will lead memory wastage.


    ii) varchar(size) / varchar2(size) :
    ===================
       > This datatype allows us to define character values such as employee names, student names, customer name etc.,

       > The maximum length of datatype is 1-4000 chracters.

       > It always allocates the memory in a Dynamic Passion.

         Example
         =======
            studentName varchar(30);

            Name of Student ::: Bhavya
   
          NOTE
          ====
            Difference between varchar (Vs) varchar2 datatype ?

               varchar is developed by SQL.

               varchar2 is developed by Oracle corporation.

3) Date : 
=========
     > This datatype allow us to defined date values in the database column such as
        DateofJoining, HireDate, BirthDate, PurchaseDate, DateofBooking, etc.,

     > The Default format of date in Oracle database is "DD-MON-YY" >>> 12-FEB-13

4) Timestamp : 
==============
     > This datatype allows us to define both date and time values into database column.

     > The default format of timestamp in Oracle database is "DD-MON-YY HH::MM::SS" >>> 12-FEB-13 18:20:35

     COMMAND - select sysdate from dual;

5) Miscellaneous :
==================
  i) Clob  >>> Character Large Object >> Which is extension of Varchar datatype >> 1GB -To - 4GB Data to Store.

  ii) Blob >>> Binary Large Object >> Which is used for storing files, audio, video etc., >>>> 1GB -To - 4GB

  iii) BFile >>> Binary File >> Which can be used for external data such as external files, binary files etc.,  >>>> 1GB -To - 4GB

********************************************
*Today Session :   Exploring on DDL Command*
********************************************
    * DDL Stands "Database Definition Language".

    * DDL Commands always deal with structure of Database Objects.

    * Database Objects means table, views, sequences, storedProcedures, storedFunctions etc.,

    * Following are the DDL Commands "create, alter, truncate, drop, rename"

    * By using DDL Commands we can apply on any Database Objects.

  1) Create
  ========= 
    * By using this DDL Command we can create any Database Object(Table, View, Sequences, Synonyms,  storedProcedures, storedFunctions)

    * As of now we are going to create any Database table (Database Object)
    
     Syntax
     ======
          create table <table_name>(columnname1 column1Datatype, Columnname2 columnname2Datatype.......columnnamen columnndatatype)

     Example
     =======
       create table demo_users(username varchar2(50),user_password varchar2(100));

  2) Alter
  ========
    * By using this DDL Command we can modify the structure of the Database Objects.

    * As of Now By using this DDL Command we can modify the structure of the Database Table.

    *By using this command we can perform below thigs.

            i) we can add the new column to the existing table.

           ii) we can remove/drop the existing column from table.

          iii) we can rename column names for existing columns in table.

           iv) we can modify the datatypes for existing columns in table. 
      
    i) Adding new column into Existing Table(alter-add) :
    =====================================================
      >> This command is used to add one column (or) more than one column to the existing table.

      Syntax
      ======
          alter table <table_name> add(columnname1 columnname1Datatype........columnnamen columnndatatype);

      Example
      =======
        SQL >> Alter table demo_users add(gender char(1), city_name varchar2(50));

      NOTE :
      ======
        >>> We cannot add the new columns at required positions in the table.

        >>> Always newly added columns will be added at end of existing column.

    ii) we can remove/drop the existing column from table(alter-drop)
    =================================================================
        * This command is used to remove the columns from the existing Database table.

        * By using this command either we can drop one column (or) more than one at a time.

        Syntax
        ======
           alter table<table_name> drop column <columnname-1>; -- Removing only one column

           alter table <table_name> drop (columnname-1,columnname-2......columnname-n);

        Example
        =======
          SQL >>> alter table demo_employees drop column created_dt; -- Removing the one column.

          SQL >>> alter table demo_employees drop(created_dt,dob); -- Removing the multiple columns.

    iii) we can rename column names for existing columns in table(alter-rename)
