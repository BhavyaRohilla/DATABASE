INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE CONCEPTS
=================================

1) Understanding the Data & Database & Database Management System (DBMS)
========================================================================
        Data >> Information about any Real World Object
            Ex:- Chairs, Tables, Mobiles, Computer, Laptop, Student, Employee, Customer etc...,

        Example : If we are considering the College Management System of Student

            Student
            =======
            RollNo, Name, Branch, Gender, Age ---> Data (It is something particular about one student)

        Database >> Grouping of Data in structured Format (or) Grouping of Several Student Information.

          Student1                        Student2                      Student3
          ========                        ========                      ========
       RollNo  : 1121                  RollNo  : 2255                RollNo  : 8956
       Name    : Bhavya                Name    : Sweety              Name    : Ram
       Branch  : CSE                   Branch  : IT                  Branch  : ECE
       Gender  : Male                  Gender  : Female              Gender  : Male
       Age     : 22                    Age     : 21                  Age     : 30


        Database Management System(DBMS) >> It is a technique for storing and reteriving the information from
                                            Database. 

        In this Digital Era (or) In our Day-2-Day life we are seeing the lot of application such as Naukri Portal,
        Monster Portal, Flipkart, Amazon etc...,

        EndUser >> Interacting the Application >> Runs in Server at Remote Machine >> Servers Connected To Database
        (Managing the Information of an Application).

2) Various techniques for Managing the Data
===========================================
    
    >> Traditional Approach (Books (or) Ledger Books) >> Collection of Pages >> Each Page >>
       One Student Information.
    
        Problems
        ========
        1) Security Challenges.
        2) Backup issues.
        3) Space issues.
        4) Costly.
        5) Time consuming for retrieving particular Student Information.


    >> In the 1940's computers wes discovered and people are thinking to store this kind of information in computer.

    >> After discovering the computer the people are managing the data in the form of Files (or) File System.
       
        Problems
        ========
        1) Security Challenges
        2) Data Redundancy >> Duplication of Data (or) Repeatitive Data.

            Student.txt                                  StudentBranches.txt
            ===========                                  ===================
            StudentID  StudentName                       StudentID  BranchName
            ---------  -----------                       ---------  ----------
        3) Data Inconsistency : When ever we are updating studentID in One file may forget to update in another file.
           
            Student.txt                                  StudentBranches.txt
            ===========                                  ===================
            StudentID  StudentName                       StudentID  BranchName
            ---------  -----------                       ---------  ----------
        4) Time Consuming For Storing and Retrieving Information from Files (or) FileSystem (or) Flat Files.
        5) We can't maintaining the Backups of files.
        6) We can store limited amount of Information Only in Files.

    Database Softwares
    ==================
      * Currently In Market we are managing the of an application in Database Softwares.


      Advantages
      ==========
      1) Strong Security.
      2) Manage and Storing and Retreving the Information.
      3) We can store the huge Amount of Information in Database.
      4) we can maintain the data in database in structured format(Tables(Rows and Columns)).
          Table >> Realworld Entity >> Student.
          Columns >> Fields >> Rollno, Name, Branch, Gender.
          Rows >> Values >> 123, Bhavya, CSE, Male.
      5) No Data Redundancy.
      6) Data Integrity.
      7) Association.

3) Database Softwares
=====================
    - Oracle Database >> Oracle Corporation >> Propertiary License
    - MySql Database >> Oracle Corporation >> Open Source
    - DB2 Database >> IBM Corporation
    - SQL Server Database >> Microsoft Corporation
    - Derby Database >> Sun MicroSystem
    - PostgreSql Database etc.....,

  NOTE :
  ------ 
  - The above database comes under category "RDBMS Database Softwares". 
  - In the Relational Database Management System the data will be managed in the form of Relations(Tables).
  - In the Relational Database Management System always data will be in Structured Fromat i.e.,Tables
  - Table will contains Rows & Columns with Respective to the RDBMS Columns >> Fields
                                                                    Rows    >> Tuples
                                                                    Tables  >> Relations


    customers(Table)
    ================
    Customer_ID       Customer_Name         Customer_Location
    ===========       =============         =================
      1025              Bhavya                  Haryana           >>Tuples
      1026              Sweety                  Rajasthan         >>Tuples
      1027              Ram                     Delhi             >>Tuples
      1028              Sham                    Goa               >>Tuples
      1029              Geeta                   Hyderabad         >>Tuples

    - Fields >> Customer_ID,Customer_Name,Customer_Location.
    - Program ::: Only Two RDBMS Softwares (Oracle,MySQL)
    - Generally In RealWorld who one person will communicate with another person >> Language >> English(Communication).
    - If the enduser wanted to communicate with RDBMS Database Softwares >> Language >> SQL(Structure Query Language).
    - Relational Databases are also called as "SQL Databases"

                                                    Day - 2

1) Types of Database Softwares
==============================
            * We have two types of Database Softwares.
                    1) RDBMS Database Software / SQL Databases : Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, PostgreSql, DB2, Derby etc..,
                       - In RDBMS/SQL Database always data will be stored in two dimensional format i.e.,Tables.
                       - Table will Contains Rows & Columns, Always Column represented as "Fields" and
                         Rows represented as "tuples" and Table represented as "Relation".
                       - In RDBMS/SQL Database always data will be stored in "Structured Format".
                       - In Realtime most of banking application, e-commerce application are using RDBMS
                         Database Softwares only.

                    2) NRDBMS Database Software / No-SQL Databases : Data will be managed in several Formats.
                              -Document based Databases >> No SQL Database >> Mongo DB >> Internally Data will be stored in
                                                                                          JSON Format.
                              {
                                "customerId":"123",
                                "customerName":"Bhavya"
                              } 

                              - Key-Value Based Database >> No SQL Database >> Cassandra DB, Dynamo DB.
                              - Column Based Database >> No SQL Database >> HBase etc....
                              - Graph Database >> No SQL Database >> Neo4J, GraphQL etc.., 

    * Database is meant for storing data of an Application.
    * Always Data will be Populated into Database from Several Application.
       Ex: Internet Banking >> We are performing some transaction on day-2-day Activities this will leads generate data
                               into database.

                                                    Day - 3

Structured Query Language(SQL)
==============================
                - SQL Stands for structured Query Language.
                - SQL is used to communicate with any RDBMS Database Softwares.
                - SQL is database Query language/ database programming language.
                - As End user we can pass statement to execute in Database such statements called "SQL statement / Queries".
                - SQL statements are just like normal English statements.
                - We can write the sql statements either in upper case letter (or) lower case letters i.e., SQL is 
                  case-Insensitive Database programming language.
                - SQL Language becomes ANSI(American National Standard Information) Standard will become common language 
                  for any RDBMS Database software /SQL Database softwares.
                - When we writing the SQL Statements every SQL statements must be terminated with Semicolon(;).
                - In SQL at a time only one SQL Statement will be executed.
                - If we wanted to execute some bunch of SQL statement at a time for you buisness requirement we need to go for 
                  "PLSQL".
                - Procedural Language using SQL.
    
  Example
  =======

    customers(Table)
    ================
    Customer_ID       Customer_Name         Customer_Location
    ===========       =============         =================
      1026              Sweety                  Rajasthan      
      1027              Ram                     Delhi          
      1025              Bhavya                  Haryana        
      1028              Sham                    Goa            
      1029              Geeta                   Hyderabad      

 * If we store the above customer information into database we can get the particular customer information based on our
   buisness requirement in easy manner.

   EndUser >> Writing SQL Statement >> Based on buisness requirement (need to get All Customer Information belongs
                                       to Hyderabad)

            select * from customers where Customer_Location='Hyderabad'; >> SQL Statement (or) Query >> Milli Seconds
                                                                            information will be infront of you.

            select * from customer; >> It will give you all customer information.

Today Session
=============

1) What is Oracle?
==================
     * Oracle is an one of the RDBMS Database Software which can maintain the data in structured Format.
     * In Oracle Always Data will be stored in two-dimensional Format / Tabular Format.
     * Oracle Database is From Oracle Corporation.
     * Using SQL Language we can interact with Oracle Database.
     * Oracle contains two Parts
        1) SQL >> Which is used to storing and managing and retreving Data from database software.
        2) PLSQL >> Executing some buisness rules/buisness logic in Database Software using stored procedure, Stored Functions.
     * Oracle Latest Version of Express Edition : Oracle 21C Express Edition.

2) Installing Oracle (or) Enviromental setup For Oracle
=======================================================
    Step-1 : We are going to Install the Oracle 11g Express Edition which is an Light weight version of Oracle
             Database and download the Oracle Database in the below url.
       URl : https://www.mediafire.com/file/ungqk8ggwof4h1h/OracleXE112_Win64.zip/file 

    Step-2 : After Completion of Downloading need to extract the zip file into folder by using either 
             winzip/7Zip Software.
           Extracting the ZIP File  >>>>>>> Normal Folder

    Step-3 : Open the Extracted the Folder and find the executable file(.exe file) 
             in below location in extracted folder.
           <Oracle_Home>\DISK1\setup.exe
           <Oracle_Home>  >> A Place where Oracle Database Software is available i.e.,Oracle Home

    Step-4 : Complete the installation process just by double clicking on it 
             untill finish button (or) Just like normal Software Installation process in our machine.

    Step-5 : During the Oracle Database Installation we need to rememeber password given for DBA
             Account(sys (or) system) and we provided the password for DBA accounts in my case as "**********".

NOTE : Just For Your Information
================================
Destination Folder: C:\oraclexe\
Oracle Home: C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\
Oracle Base:C:\oraclexe\
Port for 'Oracle Database Listener': 1521
Port for 'Oracle Services for Microsoft Transaction Server': 2030
Port for 'Oracle HTTP Listener': 8080

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Interacting with Oracle Database
================================
* Inorder to interact with Oracle database, Oracle vendor provided "SQL* Plus editor" which is an "Command Line Interface"

   Go to Start menu >> Search word as  "SQL" >> Find the Option as "Run SQL Command Line prompt" will comes along with the 
   Oracle 11g Express edition installation process

* After opening the SQL Command Line execute the below command to connect with oracle Database Software

     SQL> connect(Hit Enter)
     Enter user-name: system(Hit Enter)
     Enter password:manager(Password will not visible to You just we need to type password and hit on enter)
     Connected.

     SQL>> Show user  (Viewing current user name)
  
     SQL>> cl scr (clear screen)
  
     SQL>> exit (Quit from SQL Prompt)
     
     SQL>> select * from all_users;
