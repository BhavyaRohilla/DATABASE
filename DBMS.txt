INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE CONCEPTS
=================================

1) Understanding the Data & Database & Database Management System (DBMS)
========================================================================
        Data >> Information about any Real World Object
            Ex:- Chairs, Tables, Mobiles, Computer, Laptop, Student, Employee, Customer etc...,

        Example : If we are considering the College Management System of Student

            Student
            =======
            RollNo, Name, Branch, Gender, Age ---> Data (It is something particular about one student)

        Database >> Grouping of Data in structured Format (or) Grouping of Several Student Information.

          Student1                        Student2                      Student3
          ========                        ========                      ========
       RollNo  : 1121                  RollNo  : 2255                RollNo  : 8956
       Name    : Bhavya                Name    : Sweety              Name    : Ram
       Branch  : CSE                   Branch  : IT                  Branch  : ECE
       Gender  : Male                  Gender  : Female              Gender  : Male
       Age     : 22                    Age     : 21                  Age     : 30


        Database Management System(DBMS) >> It is a technique for storing and reteriving the information from
                                            Database. 

        In this Digital Era (or) In our Day-2-Day life we are seeing the lot of application such as Naukri Portal,
        Monster Portal, Flipkart, Amazon etc...,

        EndUser >> Interacting the Application >> Runs in Server at Remote Machine >> Servers Connected To Database
        (Managing the Information of an Application).

2) Various techniques for Managing the Data
===========================================
    
    >> Traditional Approach (Books (or) Ledger Books) >> Collection of Pages >> Each Page >>
       One Student Information.
    
        Problems
        ========
        1) Security Challenges.
        2) Backup issues.
        3) Space issues.
        4) Costly.
        5) Time consuming for retrieving particular Student Information.


    >> In the 1940's computers wes discovered and people are thinking to store this kind of information in computer.

    >> After discovering the computer the people are managing the data in the form of Files (or) File System.
       
        Problems
        ========
        1) Security Challenges
        2) Data Redundancy >> Duplication of Data (or) Repeatitive Data.

            Student.txt                                  StudentBranches.txt
            ===========                                  ===================
            StudentID  StudentName                       StudentID  BranchName
            ---------  -----------                       ---------  ----------
        3) Data Inconsistency : When ever we are updating studentID in One file may forget to update in another file.
           
            Student.txt                                  StudentBranches.txt
            ===========                                  ===================
            StudentID  StudentName                       StudentID  BranchName
            ---------  -----------                       ---------  ----------
        4) Time Consuming For Storing and Retrieving Information from Files (or) FileSystem (or) Flat Files.
        5) We can't maintaining the Backups of files.
        6) We can store limited amount of Information Only in Files.

    Database Softwares
    ==================
      * Currently In Market we are managing the of an application in Database Softwares.


      Advantages
      ==========
      1) Strong Security.
      2) Manage and Storing and Retreving the Information.
      3) We can store the huge Amount of Information in Database.
      4) we can maintain the data in database in structured format(Tables(Rows and Columns)).
          Table >> Realworld Entity >> Student.
          Columns >> Fields >> Rollno, Name, Branch, Gender.
          Rows >> Values >> 123, Bhavya, CSE, Male.
      5) No Data Redundancy.
      6) Data Integrity.
      7) Association.

3) Database Softwares
=====================
    - Oracle Database >> Oracle Corporation >> Propertiary License
    - MySql Database >> Oracle Corporation >> Open Source
    - DB2 Database >> IBM Corporation
    - SQL Server Database >> Microsoft Corporation
    - Derby Database >> Sun MicroSystem
    - PostgreSql Database etc.....,

  NOTE :
  ------ 
  - The above database comes under category "RDBMS Database Softwares". 
  - In the Relational Database Management System the data will be managed in the form of Relations(Tables).
  - In the Relational Database Management System always data will be in Structured Fromat i.e.,Tables
  - Table will contains Rows & Columns with Respective to the RDBMS Columns >> Fields
                                                                    Rows    >> Tuples
                                                                    Tables  >> Relations


    customers(Table)
    ================
    Customer_ID       Customer_Name         Customer_Location
    ===========       =============         =================
      1025              Bhavya                  Haryana           >>Tuples
      1026              Sweety                  Rajasthan         >>Tuples
      1027              Ram                     Delhi             >>Tuples
      1028              Sham                    Goa               >>Tuples
      1029              Geeta                   Hyderabad         >>Tuples

    - Fields >> Customer_ID,Customer_Name,Customer_Location.
    - Program ::: Only Two RDBMS Softwares (Oracle,MySQL)
    - Generally In RealWorld who one person will communicate with another person >> Language >> English(Communication).
    - If the enduser wanted to communicate with RDBMS Database Softwares >> Language >> SQL(Structure Query Language).
    - Relational Databases are also called as "SQL Databases"

                                                    Day - 2

1) Types of Database Softwares
==============================
            * We have two types of Database Softwares.
                    1) RDBMS Database Software / SQL Databases : Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, PostgreSql, DB2, Derby etc..,
                       - In RDBMS/SQL Database always data will be stored in two dimensional format i.e.,Tables.
                       - Table will Contains Rows & Columns, Always Column represented as "Fields" and
                         Rows represented as "tuples" and Table represented as "Relation".
                       - In RDBMS/SQL Database always data will be stored in "Structured Format".
                       - In Realtime most of banking application, e-commerce application are using RDBMS
                         Database Softwares only.

                    2) NRDBMS Database Software / No-SQL Databases : Data will be managed in several Formats.
                              -Document based Databases >> No SQL Database >> Mongo DB >> Internally Data will be stored in
                                                                                          JSON Format.
                              {
                                "customerId":"123",
                                "customerName":"Bhavya"
                              } 

                              - Key-Value Based Database >> No SQL Database >> Cassandra DB, Dynamo DB.
                              - Column Based Database >> No SQL Database >> HBase etc....
                              - Graph Database >> No SQL Database >> Neo4J, GraphQL etc.., 

    * Database is meant for storing data of an Application.
    * Always Data will be Populated into Database from Several Application.
       Ex: Internet Banking >> We are performing some transaction on day-2-day Activities this will leads generate data
                               into database.

                                                    Day - 3

Structured Query Language(SQL)
==============================
                - SQL Stands for structured Query Language.
                - SQL is used to communicate with any RDBMS Database Softwares.
                - SQL is database Query language/ database programming language.
                - As End user we can pass statement to execute in Database such statements called "SQL statement / Queries".
                - SQL statements are just like normal English statements.
                - We can write the sql statements either in upper case letter (or) lower case letters i.e., SQL is 
                  case-Insensitive Database programming language.
                - SQL Language becomes ANSI(American National Standard Information) Standard will become common language 
                  for any RDBMS Database software /SQL Database softwares.
                - When we writing the SQL Statements every SQL statements must be terminated with Semicolon(;).
                - In SQL at a time only one SQL Statement will be executed.
                - If we wanted to execute some bunch of SQL statement at a time for you buisness requirement we need to go for 
                  "PLSQL".
                - Procedural Language using SQL.
    
  Example
  =======

    customers(Table)
    ================
    Customer_ID       Customer_Name         Customer_Location
    ===========       =============         =================
      1026              Sweety                  Rajasthan      
      1027              Ram                     Delhi          
      1025              Bhavya                  Haryana        
      1028              Sham                    Goa            
      1029              Geeta                   Hyderabad      

 * If we store the above customer information into database we can get the particular customer information based on our
   buisness requirement in easy manner.

   EndUser >> Writing SQL Statement >> Based on buisness requirement (need to get All Customer Information belongs
                                       to Hyderabad)

            select * from customers where Customer_Location='Hyderabad'; >> SQL Statement (or) Query >> Milli Seconds
                                                                            information will be infront of you.

            select * from customer; >> It will give you all customer information.

Today Session
=============

1) What is Oracle?
==================
     * Oracle is an one of the RDBMS Database Software which can maintain the data in structured Format.
     * In Oracle Always Data will be stored in two-dimensional Format / Tabular Format.
     * Oracle Database is From Oracle Corporation.
     * Using SQL Language we can interact with Oracle Database.
     * Oracle contains two Parts
        1) SQL >> Which is used to storing and managing and retreving Data from database software.
        2) PLSQL >> Executing some buisness rules/buisness logic in Database Software using stored procedure, Stored Functions.
     * Oracle Latest Version of Express Edition : Oracle 21C Express Edition.

2) Installing Oracle (or) Enviromental setup For Oracle
=======================================================
    Step-1 : We are going to Install the Oracle 11g Express Edition which is an Light weight version of Oracle
             Database and download the Oracle Database in the below url.
       URl : https://www.mediafire.com/file/ungqk8ggwof4h1h/OracleXE112_Win64.zip/file 

    Step-2 : After Completion of Downloading need to extract the zip file into folder by using either 
             winzip/7Zip Software.
           Extracting the ZIP File  >>>>>>> Normal Folder

    Step-3 : Open the Extracted the Folder and find the executable file(.exe file) 
             in below location in extracted folder.
           <Oracle_Home>\DISK1\setup.exe
           <Oracle_Home>  >> A Place where Oracle Database Software is available i.e.,Oracle Home

    Step-4 : Complete the installation process just by double clicking on it 
             untill finish button (or) Just like normal Software Installation process in our machine.

    Step-5 : During the Oracle Database Installation we need to rememeber password given for DBA
             Account(sys (or) system) and we provided the password for DBA accounts in my case as "**********".

NOTE : Just For Your Information
================================
Destination Folder: C:\oraclexe\
Oracle Home: C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\
Oracle Base:C:\oraclexe\
Port for 'Oracle Database Listener': 1521
Port for 'Oracle Services for Microsoft Transaction Server': 2030
Port for 'Oracle HTTP Listener': 8080

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Interacting with Oracle Database
================================
* Inorder to interact with Oracle database, Oracle vendor provided "SQL* Plus editor" which is an "Command Line Interface"

   Go to Start menu >> Search word as  "SQL" >> Find the Option as "Run SQL Command Line prompt" will comes along with the 
   Oracle 11g Express edition installation process

* After opening the SQL Command Line execute the below command to connect with oracle Database Software

     SQL> connect(Hit Enter)
     Enter user-name: system(Hit Enter)
     Enter password:manager(Password will not visible to You just we need to type password and hit on enter)
     Connected.

     SQL>> Show user  (Viewing current user name)
  
     SQL>> cl scr (clear screen)
  
     SQL>> exit (Quit from SQL Prompt)
     
     SQL>> select * from all_users;

                                                    Day - 5

Interacting with Oracle Database
=================================
Approach-1 
----------
Using Command Line Interface(CLI) oracle Database i.e.,Sql*plus

  Start Menu >> Search Word "sql" >> Find option "Run SQL Command Line" >> Select that Option will open SQL Prompt


     SQL >>  Connect 


     Enter Username ::: System

     Enter Password ::: manager(not visible)

     Connected


     SQL >> show user

      OUTPUT
      ======
       system

 
      SQL >> Select * from all_users;  >> To get all the users information from Oracle Database

       OUTPUT
       ======
         Users Information

      SQL>> cl scr  >>> Clearing the Screen


      SQL >> exit   >>> Exiting the SQL Prompt

Approach-2 
----------
>>  By Using Oracle WebPage we can interact with Oracle Database and during installation of Oracle11g Express Edition we got      one webpage into our Machine Desktop  i.e., "Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition"


>>  When we Open the following page i.e.,Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition by default it will given you an
 
    error because need to configure the Oracle Port Listener Number(8080) for this webPage.


>>> Adding the Oracle Listener Port Number to the above web page

    Right Click on the web page >>> choose an option "Open File Location" >>> select "Get Started" Page and Right click on  
    this page >>> Select the option "Properties" >> Change the url as below

          Exisiting URL ::::    http://127.0.0.1:%HTTPPORT%/apex/f?p=4950 

 
          Changed URL   ::::   http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4950 

>>> After the doing the Above url change now just try to open the Same Page.....Will be getting Some Home Page 

    Select option "Application Express" >> will getting another Screen infront of you

             Create Database User  >>> Create new User (Select this Option)

                 Username          >>> bhavya

    Application Express Workspace  >>> bhavya

                 Password          >>>  (Invisible Characters)

       Confirm Password            >>>  (Invisible Characters)


   We need to Click on button  "Create Workspace" >>After clicking on it will get Success Message workspace got created.


>>> We need to Login with New credentials of an Newly created workspace

          Workspace name  :::: bhavya

          username        :::: bhavya

          password        :::: 124444

         Click on  "Login" Button

>>> After Login we need select menu "SQL Workshop"

       1) SQL Commands    >>> Here we can write the required Sql Commands to test with oracle Database


       2) Object Browser  >>> We can see the Oracle Database Objects information (table,views,sequences,SP,SF etc.,)

                          >>> Using this option we can create any Database Object using graphical Objects.

Approach - 3
------------
      * we can interact with oracle Database by using Graphical User Interface(GUI) Tools.
      * Inorder to interact with Oracle Database we have some GUI Tools i.e.,Oracle SQL Developer, Toad For Oracle tec...,

ERROR:ORA-12543: TNS:destination host unreachable
=================================================
1) Verify Services in our machine related Oracle.

   Go to run option  >> Type word  "services.msc" >> Find oracle related Services is in Running or not

             OracleXETNSListener    >> Running

             OracleServiceXE        >> Running

2) Navigate to Oracle Installation Folder >> Search with following file "tnsnames.ora"  >> Edit this file and change the    service name XE  >> ORCL.


3) Verify Your system is enabled with Firewall or not, If it enabled just disable it and try onces


ERROR : Checking for Oracle XE service instance FAILED, How to solve this problem sir
=====================================================================================
Solution ::: Swith to Command Prompt  >>> type the below command 

               C:\Users\NEW>sc delete OracleServiceXE

**********************************
Interacting with Oracle Database
**********************************
Approach-1 
----------
Using Command Line Interface(CLI) oracle Database i.e.,Sql*plus

  Start Menu >> Search Word "sql" >> Find option "Run SQL Command Line" >> Select that Option will open SQL Prompt


     SQL >>  Connect 


     Enter Username ::: System

     Enter Password ::: (not visible)

     Connected


     SQL >> show user

      OUTPUT
      ======
       system

 
      SQL >> Select * from all_users;  >> To get all the users information from Oracle Database

       OUTPUT
       ======
         Users Information

      SQL>> cl scr  >>> Clearing the Screen


      SQL >> exit   >>> Exiting the SQL Prompt

Approach-2 
----------
>>  By Using Oracle WebPage we can interact with Oracle Database and during installation of Oracle11g Express Edition we got 
    one webpage into our Machine Desktop  i.e., "Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition"


>>  When we Open the following page i.e.,Get Started With Oracle Database 11g Express Edition by default it will given you an 
    error because need to configure the Oracle Port Listener Number(8080) for this webPage.


>>> Adding the Oracle Listener Port Number to the above web page
    Right Click on the web page >>> choose an option "Open File Location" >>> select "Get Started" Page and Right click on  
    this page >>> Select the option "Properties" >> Change the url as below

          Exisiting URL ::::    http://127.0.0.1:%HTTPPORT%/apex/f?p=4950 

 
          Changed URL   ::::   http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4950 

>>> After the doing the Above url change now just try to open the Same Page.....Will be getting Some Home Page 
    Select option "Application Express" >> will getting another Screen infront of you

             Create Database User  >>> Create new User (Select this Option)

                 Username          >>> bhavya

    Application Express Workspace  >>> bhavya

                 Password          >>> (Invisible Characters)

       Confirm Password            >>> (Invisible Characters)


   We need to Click on button  "Create Workspace" >>After clicking on it will get Success Message workspace got created.


>>> We need to Login with New credentials of an Newly created workspace

          Workspace name  :::: bhavya

          username        :::: bhavya

          password        :::: ******

         Click on  "Login" Button

>>> After Login we need select menu "SQL Workshop"

       1) SQL Commands    >>> Here we can write the required Sql Commands to test with oracle Database


       2) Object Browser  >>> We can see the Oracle Database Objects information (table,views,sequences,SP,SF etc.,)

                          >>> Using this option we can create any Database Object using graphical Objects.

Approach-3
==========
 * We can interact with Oracle Database by using Graphical User Interface(GUI) Tools.

 * Inorder to interact with Oracle Database we have some GUI Tools i.e.,Oracle SQL Developer,Toad For Oracle etc..,

Step-1 :
--------
Downlaod the SQL Developer Software from Oracle Corporation.
 
  URL :https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/  >>> Current Version (22.2.1)

 NOTE
 ====
  If we required to download the Oracle Products definetly need to have account with Oracle WebSite.
  
      Oracle Products ::: Oracle 11g Express Edition , Oracle SQL Developer Tool, Java Software etc.,

Step-2
------
 After completion of Download as zip file we need to extract the Zip file to Normal Folder by using either winzip/7-zip     Software

      sqldeveloper-22.2.1.234.1810-x64.zip   >>>>> sqldeveloper-22.2.1.234.1810-x64(Normal Folder)

Step-3
------
  Switch/navigate to Extracted Folder and click on following executable file i.e.,sqldeveloper.exe and will open Sql      Developer tool page.  
  
  In the left hand side we have two panels 1) Connections 2) Reports 

Step-4
------
  We need to create new Connection in SQL Developer Tool by clicking on "Green Color + Icon" onces you clicked on it 
  need to provide the below Inputs
     
       Connection Name :::  DBA_CONNECTION   (Given Color as Red Color)

        username : system

        password : ******

        Hostname : localhost

        port :1521

        sid : xe

  We need to Verify the whether Database Connection will be success or not by clicking on "Test" Button.

  If we are getting success then we need to click on "Connect" Button

Step-5
------
  We need to SQL Queries/SQL Statements by using SQL Developer Tool

  Right Click on Connection Name(DBA_CONNECTION) under Connection Panel >> Choose an Option "Open SQL Work Sheet".

  Once SQL Worksheet got Opened we can write and test our required SQL statements

     select sysdate from dual;

  Executing the above Statement ::::: select the entire sql statement(ctrl+A) >>>> Click on "Run" Button(Green Color) on tool 
  bar.


NOTE
=====
1) We can able to login DBA Account(system,manager) either in Webpage (or) SQL*plus Client Application.

2) We can able to login Database Developer Account(mahesh(ashokit), rajesh(ashokit)) either in webpage (or) sql*plus client   
   application
